# About Tweeter
Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone of which I used HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, AJAX for my front-end practice as well as Node, Express and MongoDB for back-end. This project gave me a lot of exposure and practice with jQuer and CSS along with learning SASS (sass is not implemented).
